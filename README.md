# fluent-ui-blur.css
CSS implementation of Microsoft's Fluent UI blur effect seen in Windows 10 apps.

Simply add one class to an element (either `.fluent-ui-blur-light` or `.fluent-ui-blur-dark`) and that's it!

Note that this uses the `backdrop-filter` CSS property, which means browser support may vary, but it'll work perfectly on Chromium based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

## Example 
Top is light blur, bottom is dark blur
