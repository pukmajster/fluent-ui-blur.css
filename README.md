# fluent-ui-blur.css
CSS implementation of Microsoft's Fluent UI blur effect seen in Windows 10 apps.

Simply add one class to an element (in this case .fluent-ui-blur) and that's it!

Note that this uses the `backdrop-filter` CSS property, which means browser support may vary, but it'll work perfectly on Chromium based browsers such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
